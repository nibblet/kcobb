## Open Issues

### [FIX-013] Uncaught Exception in /api/tell/draft When Fenced JSON is Malformed
- **Status:** planned
- **Severity:** Low — Claude rarely returns fenced-but-invalid JSON; contributor sees a broken spinner with no user-friendly message if it occurs
- **Found:** 2026-04-15
- **Plan:** `docs/nightshift/plans/FIXPLAN-FIX-013-tell-draft-fenced-json-throw.md`
- **Summary:** The secondary `JSON.parse(fenced[1])` call in the catch block of `/api/tell/draft/route.ts` is not wrapped in its own try/catch. If the fenced content is also malformed, the exception propagates uncaught. Fix: wrap the secondary parse in a try/catch with the same error logging and response pattern as the outer fallback.

### [FIX-014] ageMode Not Validated at Runtime in /api/ask
- **Status:** planned
- **Severity:** Low — family-only app; trusted users. If any client sends a non-enum ageMode value, `AGE_MODE_INSTRUCTIONS[ageMode]` silently returns `undefined`, which is interpolated as the string `"undefined"` in the system prompt.
- **Found:** 2026-04-15
- **Plan:** `docs/nightshift/plans/FIXPLAN-FIX-014-agemode-not-validated.md`
- **Summary:** Add a runtime validation guard after destructuring `ageMode` from the request body. If the value is not one of `["young_reader", "teen", "adult"]`, default to `"adult"`. One-line fix.

### [FIX-016] Tell Page SSE State Mutation (Strict Mode Double-Append Risk)
- **Status:** planned
- **Severity:** Low-Medium — in React Strict Mode (Next.js dev), SSE text chunks may double-append since the state updater mutates the object in-place; violates React immutability contract
- **Found:** 2026-04-15
- **Plan:** `docs/nightshift/plans/FIXPLAN-FIX-016-tell-sse-mutation.md`
- **Summary:** `tell/page.tsx` (now `StoryContributionWorkspace.tsx`) `sendMessage()` mutates `last.content += data.text` inside `setMessages`. `ask/page.tsx` already uses the correct immutable batch pattern. Port that pattern to `StoryContributionWorkspace.tsx`.

---

### [FIX-017] Multiple Draft Rows Created for One Tell Session
- **Status:** planned
- **Severity:** Low — produces orphaned draft rows in `sb_story_drafts`; session status stuck at `drafting` when user goes back to chat
- **Found:** 2026-04-15
- **Plan:** `docs/nightshift/plans/FIXPLAN-FIX-017-multiple-drafts-per-session.md`
- **Summary:** Composing a draft, going back to chat, then composing again creates a second `sb_story_drafts` row. Fix: upsert in draft API (update if draft exists for session). Also reset session status to `gathering` via PATCH when user clicks "Keep Talking".

### [FIX-019] `_history` Unused Parameter Lint Warning in classifier.ts
- **Status:** planned
- **Severity:** Very Low — 1 ESLint warning; no runtime impact. Lint was previously clean (0 warnings) so this represents a regression.
- **Found:** 2026-04-16
- **Plan:** `docs/nightshift/plans/FIXPLAN-FIX-019-classifier-lint.md`
- **Summary:** `src/lib/ai/classifier.ts` line 43: `_history` parameter has an underscore prefix but the project's ESLint config still warns on it. Add `// eslint-disable-next-line @typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars` on the line before. One-line fix, pairs with FIX-020.

---

### [FIX-020] `<img>` ESLint Warnings in StoryMarkdown.tsx
- **Status:** planned
- **Severity:** Very Low — 2 `@next/next/no-img-element` warnings; no runtime impact. Lint had 1 warning before this run; these add 2 more. Raw `<img>` is intentional here (dynamic sources, unknown dimensions at compile time, `loading="lazy"` already present).
- **Found:** 2026-04-17
- **Plan:** `docs/nightshift/plans/FIXPLAN-FIX-020-storymarkdown-img-warnings.md`
- **Summary:** `src/components/story/StoryMarkdown.tsx` lines 34 and 100 use raw `<img>` tags inside a `ReactMarkdown` custom renderer and a lightbox. `next/image` is impractical here (dynamic sources, unknown dimensions). Fix: add targeted `eslint-disable-next-line @next/next/no-img-element` comments at both locations. Two-line fix.

- **Status:** resolved
- **Severity:** Low

- **Plan:** `docs/nightshift/plans/FIXPLAN-FIX-014-tell-double-submit.md`

- **Status:** resolved
- **Severity:** Low
- **Found:** 2026-04-15

- **Plan:** `docs/nightshift/plans/FIXPLAN-FIX-015-submit-draft-no-guard.md`

- **Plan:** `docs/nightshift/plans/FIXPLAN-FIX-009-tell-draft-rate-limiting.md`
- **Summary:** Added rate limiting to `/api/tell/draft` (`5/min` per user with `Retry-After`) and removed raw Claude response leakage from parse-failure API errors.

- **Status:** resolved

- **Found:** 2026-04-14
- **Resolved:** 2026-04-14
- **Plan:** `docs/nightshift/plans/FIXPLAN-FIX-010-tell-prompts-wiki-cache.md`
- **Summary:** Added module-level wiki summary caching in `tell-prompts.ts` so Tell prompt builds reuse cached `index.md` content instead of re-reading every request.
