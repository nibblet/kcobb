# Fix: [FIX-001] Next.js 16 Middleware Deprecation — Rename to proxy.ts

## Problem
The build emits a warning on every build:
> "The 'middleware' file convention is deprecated. Please use 'proxy' instead."

In Next.js 16.2.3, the `middleware.ts` file convention at the app root has been replaced by `proxy.ts`. Using the old name is deprecated and will eventually stop working, breaking all auth protection across the app.

**Impact:** Currently functional but will break in a future Next.js 16 patch; every build produces a warning that obscures real errors.

## Root Cause
`src/middleware.ts` exists at the app root. Next.js 16 changed the auth-enforcement file convention from `middleware` to `proxy`. The Supabase SSR session update logic lives there and protects all non-auth routes.

## Steps
1. Open `src/middleware.ts` — read the full file to confirm contents
2. Create `src/proxy.ts`: same imports and `config` as before, but rename the exported handler from `middleware` to **`proxy`** (Next.js requires `export async function proxy` or a default export for `proxy.ts`).
3. Delete `src/middleware.ts`
4. Verify the `config` export in `src/proxy.ts` still has the correct `matcher` — it should remain unchanged
5. Run `npm run build` — confirm the deprecation warning is gone
6. Run `npm run lint` — confirm no new errors

## Implementation notes (2026-04-13)
- Applied as above; `next build` reports route line `ƒ Proxy (Middleware)` and no “middleware file convention is deprecated” warning.

## Files Modified
- `src/middleware.ts` — **deleted**
- `src/proxy.ts` — **new file** (`proxy` handler + same `config` as former middleware)

## New Files
- `src/proxy.ts` — Next.js 16 proxy convention for Supabase session refresh and auth-guard redirect

## Database Changes
None

## Verify
- [x] Build passes with no deprecation warning about middleware
- [ ] Accessing `/stories` while logged out redirects to `/login` *(manual)*
- [ ] Accessing `/login` while logged in redirects to `/` *(manual)*
- [ ] Auth callback at `/auth/callback` still works *(manual)*
