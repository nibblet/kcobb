## Run: 2026-04-18 (Run 7)

### Summary
- Scanned: 9 commits since Run 6 (4fa9d60 through 43cfb4b), all new source files (PhotoFrameOverlay, TipTapEditor, BeyondEditMode, BeyondDraftEditor, BeyondPeopleMode, BeyondModeTabs, MediaGallery, MentionSuggestion, PersonLink, PersonEditDrawer, PersonMediaPanel, StoryAudioControls + ElevenLabs lib, CorrectionActions, people routes, media routes, audio routes), 5 new migrations (013_story_corrections through 017_media), 58 new wiki people pages, build + lint
- Issues found: 2 new (FIX-021 — 4 lint errors, FIX-022 — dual 013 migration prefix) — both planned
- Issues resolved: 0 this run (all prior open issues unchanged)
- Ideas: IDEA-017 marked shipped; IDEA-012 parked (3-day stale); IDEA-019 seeded and advanced to `planned` same night; IDEA-021 seeded (reading milestone celebration)
- Plans written:
  - `FIXPLAN-FIX-021-beyond-lint-errors.md`
  - `FIXPLAN-FIX-022-dual-013-migration.md`
  - `DEVPLAN-IDEA-019-people-in-ask-keith.md`

### Build & Lint Results
- `npm run build`: **PASSES** — clean, 44 routes. New routes: `/people`, `/people/[slug]`, `/profile/admin`, `/admin/media`, plus audio/corrections/media/people API routes.
- `npm run lint`: **4 errors, 3 warnings** — regression from Run 6 (0 errors, 3 warnings). Errors: `prefer-const` in `compile-wiki.ts:564` + `react-hooks/set-state-in-effect` in `MediaGallery.tsx:269` + `MentionSuggestion.tsx:33` + `react-hooks/immutability` in `TipTapEditor.tsx:185`. All fixable in 2 minutes per FIXPLAN-FIX-021. Warnings: FIX-019 + FIX-020 (unchanged).

### Key Findings

1. **9 commits — massive Beyond + People + Audio feature wave.** Paul shipped: photo frame mode (IDEA-017), ElevenLabs server-side TTS with Supabase Storage caching, Beyond Edit Mode with TipTap WYSIWYG editor, people inventory as first-class entities with wiki pages + DB, media attachment system, story corrections, and Beyond mode tabs. The app has expanded from 38 to 44 routes.

2. **IDEA-017 (Photo Frame) SHIPPED** — `PhotoFrameOverlay.tsx` confirmed in `be2d3fd`. Full Fullscreen API, crossfade, preload, pause-on-tap. Exactly as designed.

3. **People Inventory is a major new feature.** 58 people pages compiled from `content/raw/people_inventory.json` into `content/wiki/people/`. Full biographical write-ups for Tier A subjects (Bayne Cobb, Frances Cobb, etc.) via `<!-- ai-draft -->` blocks. `/people` directory + `/people/[slug]` detail with Keith-editable drawer and media panel. `sb_people` (DB) + `sb_story_people` (link table) + `PersonLink` for @mention chips. This is the most substantial structural addition since stories themselves.

4. **Beyond is now a full authoring workspace.** Three mode tabs: QA (existing), Edit (new TipTap editor), People (new). `sb_story_drafts.session_id` is now nullable — Keith can write directly without a chat session. `origin = 'write' | 'edit'` distinguishes new drafts from story revisions. Warning gate prevents accidental overwrites of published chapters. TipTap @mention autocomplete links people via `/api/people` search.

5. **ElevenLabs TTS fully implemented.** Migration 014 creates `sb_story_audio` ledger + `story-audio` public Storage bucket. `StoryAudioControls` now defaults to `mode="elevenlabs"` and falls back to Web Speech API. Rate limited at 5/15min to bound API spend. Requires `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` + `ELEVENLABS_VOICE_ID` in env.

6. **FIX-021 (MEDIUM): 4 new lint errors** in Beyond components. All are correct-behavior code that simply needs a `const` fix or targeted eslint-disable comment. Should be fixed ASAP to restore clean lint output. Group with FIX-019/020 for a complete 5-minute lint sweep.

7. **FIX-022 (LOW): Dual `013_` migration prefix.** Two migrations start with `013_`: `013_onboarding_flags.sql` and `013_story_corrections.sql`. Alphabetical ordering means they apply consistently (`onboarding_flags` before `story_corrections`) and Supabase tracks by full filename. Low risk but confusing. Fix: add a comment in `013_story_corrections.sql` noting the naming situation. New migrations should start at `018_`.

8. **IDEA-019 seeded and planned.** The Ask Keith system prompt includes the wiki index (which lists people names) but NOT the detailed biographical content from `content/wiki/people/`. Confirmed: `content/wiki/people/bayne-cobb.md` has a 300-word bio with notable moments and a representative quote. Adding `getPeopleContext()` to `prompts.ts` would directly improve AI response quality for the most emotionally resonant family questions. Estimated 1 hour. Dev plan written.

9. **Interview stories (IV_S01–IV_S10) are in the wiki and surfaced.** Stories page has an "Interview" filter. Wiki index updated to show "49 stories (39 memoir + 10 interview)". Timeline expanded to 43 events. Static data confirms interview story integration.

### Plans Ready to Execute
- `docs/nightshift/plans/FIXPLAN-FIX-021-beyond-lint-errors.md` — 4 eslint fixes (2 min)
- `docs/nightshift/plans/FIXPLAN-FIX-019-classifier-lint.md` + `FIXPLAN-FIX-020-storymarkdown-img-warnings.md` — 3 more lint comments (2 min) — do all 3 plans together in one commit for a full lint sweep
- `docs/nightshift/plans/DEVPLAN-IDEA-019-people-in-ask-keith.md` — people bio context in Ask system prompt (1 hr)
- `docs/nightshift/plans/DEVPLAN-IDEA-018-ask-from-passage.md` — "Ask Keith about this" from highlights (1 hr)
- `docs/nightshift/plans/DEVPLAN-IDEA-014-story-read-progress-ui.md` — story card read badges, Phase 2 only (~45 min)

### Recommendations
- **If you have 5 min:** FIX-021 + FIX-019 + FIX-020 together (7 total eslint fixes across 4 files) — restores completely clean lint output. Group as one commit: "fix: clear all ESLint warnings and errors".
- **If you have 1 hour:** IDEA-019 alone (people bio context in Ask Keith). Highest AI quality improvement available. People pages are shipped, wiki bios exist, system prompt just needs one new loader function. Before/after test: ask "Who was Bayne Cobb?" — the improvement will be immediately obvious.
- **If you have 2 hours:** Lint sweep (5 min) + IDEA-019 (1 hr) + IDEA-018 (1 hr). After this session: lint clean, Ask knows who people are, highlights connect to live conversations. Three quality improvements that build on each other.

## Run: 2026-04-17 (Run 6)

### Summary
- Scanned: 3 new commits (c7ebef7, d8af9cc, 5dd3116), all new source files (StoryMarkdown.tsx, StoryBodyWithHighlighting.tsx, FavoriteButton.tsx, ProfileReadingDashboard.tsx, OnboardingStepper.tsx + demos, profile/favorites, profile/highlights, welcome, onboarding API, highlights API, favorites API, proxy.ts onboarding gate), 3 new migrations (011–013)
- Issues found: 1 new (FIX-020 `<img>` warnings in StoryMarkdown.tsx) — planned
- Issues resolved: FIX-018 (KeithProfileHero + classifier committed in c7ebef7)
- Ideas: IDEA-004, IDEA-011, IDEA-016 shipped; IDEA-013 fully shipped; IDEA-014 partially shipped (profile dashboard done, story card badges remain); IDEA-008 + IDEA-010 parked (3-day stale); IDEA-017 + IDEA-018 seeded and advanced to `ready` same night
- Plans written:
  - `FIXPLAN-FIX-020-storymarkdown-img-warnings.md`
  - `DEVPLAN-IDEA-017-photo-gallery.md`
  - `DEVPLAN-IDEA-018-ask-from-passage.md`

### Build & Lint Results
- `npm run build`: **PASSES** — clean, 38+ routes. New routes: `/profile/favorites`, `/profile/highlights`, `/welcome`, plus 6 new API routes.
- `npm run lint`: **3 warnings** — `_history` in `classifier.ts:43` (FIX-019, existing) + 2 `@next/next/no-img-element` in `StoryMarkdown.tsx:34,100` (FIX-020, new). No errors.

### Key Findings

1. **Massive shipment since Run 5 — 3 commits, 100+ files.** Three features fully landed: story favorites (IDEA-004), passage highlights (IDEA-016), and original book photos with lightbox (IDEA-011). Also: `ProfileReadingDashboard.tsx` for user reading stats, and a complete welcome/onboarding tour for new family members.

2. **IDEA-004 (Favorites) SHIPPED** — `FavoriteButton.tsx` with optimistic toggle, `sb_story_favorites` (migration 011), `/profile/favorites` grid, ProfileHero link. Clean implementation.

3. **IDEA-016 (Highlights) SHIPPED** — `StoryBodyWithHighlighting.tsx` uses the `selectionchange` DOM event to position a floating save button above the selection, within the story body container. `sb_story_highlights` (migration 012), `/profile/highlights` reading-journal view, `DeleteHighlightButton.tsx`. Rate limited at 30/min.

4. **IDEA-011 (Story Photos) SHIPPED** — Paul extracted 35 original memoir photos and created `StoryMarkdown.tsx` with a full lightbox (Escape to close, Fit to Screen / Actual Size / Open Original controls). 17 story wiki files updated with inline `![...]` image refs. Not just inline images — these are high-quality scanned photos from the physical book.

5. **Welcome/Onboarding flow SHIPPED** — `/welcome` with `OnboardingStepper.tsx` (4 steps, age-aware). New users are automatically redirected to `/welcome` by an onboarding gate in `proxy.ts` (cookie fast-path via `sb_onboarded` cookie, DB fallback via `has_onboarded` column). Existing users pre-seeded as `has_onboarded=true` in migration 013. Replay link in ProfileHero. This is a thoughtful, complete onboarding implementation.

6. **FIX-018 RESOLVED** — `KeithProfileHero.tsx` and `classifier.ts` changes committed in `c7ebef7`. Working tree is clean.

7. **FIX-020 (VERY LOW): New lint regression in StoryMarkdown.tsx.** 2 new `@next/next/no-img-element` warnings at lines 34 and 100. Raw `<img>` is intentional here (dynamic sources from markdown, unknown dimensions). Fix: 2 targeted eslint-disable-next-line comments. Should be paired with FIX-019 (1 comment) for a clean lint sweep.

8. **IDEA-017 + IDEA-018 seeded and ready.** The photo gallery is a natural next step now that 35 images are in place — a dedicated browsing experience without requiring reading specific stories. Ask from passage is the highest-value quick win — transforms the highlights page from a static archive into an active conversation launcher.

### Plans Ready to Execute
- `docs/nightshift/plans/FIXPLAN-FIX-019-classifier-lint.md` + `FIXPLAN-FIX-020-storymarkdown-img-warnings.md` — 3 total lint comments across 2 files; do together (5 min)
- `docs/nightshift/plans/DEVPLAN-IDEA-018-ask-from-passage.md` — "Ask Keith about this" from highlights (1 hr)
- `docs/nightshift/plans/DEVPLAN-IDEA-014-story-read-progress-ui.md` — story card read badges, Phase 2 only (~45 min)
- `docs/nightshift/plans/DEVPLAN-IDEA-017-photo-gallery.md` — original photos gallery at `/gallery` (2–2.5 hrs)

### Recommendations
- **If you have 10 min:** FIX-019 + FIX-020 together (3 eslint comments across 2 files) — clears all 3 lint warnings and restores clean lint output.
- **If you have 1 hour:** IDEA-018 alone (Ask from passage). Both dependencies are shipped (highlights + Ask). Immediate family value — especially meaningful for grandchildren who save a quote and want to talk about it.
- **If you have 2 hours:** IDEA-018 (1 hr) + IDEA-014 Phase 2 story card badges (~45 min) + FIX-019/020 lint sweep (5 min). After this session: lint is clean, passages connect to conversation, story cards show read history.

## Run: 2026-04-16 (Run 5 — addendum, Paul request)

### Summary
- Paul requested two new features: bookmark a story as a favorite + highlight a paragraph to save
- IDEA-004 unparked and advanced to `ready` (was parked 2026-04-15)
- IDEA-016 seeded and advanced to `ready` in one session
- Plans written:
  - `DEVPLAN-IDEA-004-story-favorites.md` — heart icon, `/profile/favorites`, migration 011
  - `DEVPLAN-IDEA-016-passage-highlights.md` — text selection, floating save button, `/profile/highlights`, migration 012

### Plans Ready to Execute
- `docs/nightshift/plans/DEVPLAN-IDEA-004-story-favorites.md` — Favorite stories (1.5–2 hrs)
- `docs/nightshift/plans/DEVPLAN-IDEA-016-passage-highlights.md` — Save passages (2–2.5 hrs)

### Recommended order
1. **IDEA-004 first** (favorites) — simpler, no complex DOM event handling. Introduces the profile subpage pattern (`/profile/favorites`) that IDEA-016 reuses.
2. **IDEA-016 second** (highlights) — builds on the profile page pattern, then adds the text-selection client component on story pages.

## Run: 2026-04-16 (Run 5)

### Summary
- Scanned: 20 commits since Run 4, all new route files (beyond, profile/questions, api/beyond/*, api/stories/*/questions, api/notifications/count), components (StoryAudioControls, ReadTracker, AnsweredQuestionsList, AskAboutStory, KeithProfileHero, KeithDashboard, ProfileNavLink), AI orchestration layer (orchestrator.ts, classifier.ts, perspectives.ts), 10 migrations, build + lint
- Issues found: 2 new (FIX-018, FIX-019) — both planned
- Issues resolved: 0 this run (FIX-013–015 all resolved in prior session)
- Ideas: 2 new `ready` (IDEA-014, IDEA-015), 2 shipped (IDEA-009, IDEA-013 infra), 2 parked (IDEA-005, IDEA-006 — 3-day stale)
- Plans written:
  - `FIXPLAN-FIX-018-uncommitted-changes.md`
  - `FIXPLAN-FIX-019-classifier-lint.md`
  - `DEVPLAN-IDEA-014-story-read-progress-ui.md`
  - `DEVPLAN-IDEA-015-deep-ask-activation.md`

### Build & Lint Results
- `npm run build`: **PASSES** — clean, 34 routes (up from 26 last run). New routes: `/beyond`, `/profile/questions`, `/journeys/[slug]/narrated`, `/stories/timeline`, and 8 new API routes.
- `npm run lint`: **1 warning** — `_history` unused in `classifier.ts:43`. No errors. (lint was previously clean — this is a regression tracked as FIX-019)

### Key Findings

1. **Massive feature wave since Run 4 (20 commits).** The app has grown substantially. Major additions: Beyond workspace (Keith's private story studio), reader Q&A system (ask-about-story → Keith triage → answer → public display), multi-perspective Ask orchestrator (3-call deep path, feature-flagged), story audio TTS (Web Speech API), story read tracking infrastructure, hub navigation, profile notifications.

2. **IDEA-009 (Story Voice Playback) SHIPPED** — `StoryAudioControls.tsx` is fully built with Web Speech API. Play/Pause/Stop, estimated listen time, aria-live status, SSR-safe. No server cost. Paul implemented without a dev plan — marking shipped.

3. **IDEA-013 (Story Reading Progress) — infra SHIPPED, UI still needed.** `sb_story_reads` table, `ReadTracker` component (fires silently on story visit), `/api/stories/[storyId]/read` endpoint, and Keith's analytics dashboard are all live. The user-facing UI (progress bar on profile, read badges on story cards) is NOT yet built. Created IDEA-014 as the UI completion task.

4. **Beyond workspace is comprehensive.** Keith has a dedicated `/beyond` page (keith role-gated) that reuses `StoryContributionWorkspace` with `contributionMode="beyond"`. The workspace shows pending reader questions in a triage strip — Keith can quick-answer (text, public/private), seed a full Beyond session, or dismiss. Session → draft → publish pipeline works identically to Tell. This closes the reader feedback loop elegantly.

5. **Multi-perspective Ask orchestrator built but not yet active in prod.** `orchestrator.ts` + `classifier.ts` + `perspectives.ts` are all confirmed in the codebase. The classifier was just inverted (defaults to "deep" for all non-factual questions). Activation requires setting `ENABLE_DEEP_ASK=true` in Vercel env. The quality improvement for reflective questions is significant. Created IDEA-015 as the activation plan.

6. **FIX-018 (MEDIUM): Two uncommitted working-tree changes.** `KeithProfileHero.tsx` (2 quick links removed, grid simplified) and `classifier.ts` (logic inversion) are both modified but not committed. A `git add + commit` resolves this in under 5 minutes. Risk: Vercel deploy from a fresh clone would lose both.

7. **FIX-019 (VERY LOW): Lint warning regression.** `classifier.ts` `_history` parameter causes `@typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars` warning. Lint was clean after FIX-012; this is a 1-line eslint-disable comment away from clean again.

8. **IDEA-005 + IDEA-006 parked** — Reading time estimate (IDEA-005, seeded 2026-04-13) and Featured Story of the Week (IDEA-006, seeded 2026-04-13) both 3 days without action. Parked per stale rule.

### Plans Ready to Execute
- `docs/nightshift/plans/FIXPLAN-FIX-018-uncommitted-changes.md` — Commit KeithProfileHero + classifier (5 min, prevents silent deploy loss)
- `docs/nightshift/plans/FIXPLAN-FIX-019-classifier-lint.md` — Fix _history lint warning (1 min, pairs with FIX-018)
- `docs/nightshift/plans/DEVPLAN-IDEA-014-story-read-progress-ui.md` — Profile progress bar + story card read badges (1–1.5 hrs)
- `docs/nightshift/plans/DEVPLAN-IDEA-015-deep-ask-activation.md` — Enable deep Ask in production (30 min eval + env var set)

### Recommendations
- **If you have 10 min:** FIX-018 (commit working tree, 5 min) + FIX-019 (lint disable comment, 1 min) back-to-back. Two lines of work that eliminate all medium/low deployment risk.
- **If you have 2 hours:** The 10-min batch above + IDEA-015 (review perspective prompts, test locally, enable `ENABLE_DEEP_ASK=true` in Vercel) + IDEA-014 (profile progress bar). After this session: the app is fully clean and the Ask feature has meaningful qualitative depth for reflective questions.
- **If you want the biggest visual win:** IDEA-014 alone (1–1.5 hrs). Family members immediately see their reading progress on their profile and know which story cards they've already visited. Closes the loop on the read tracking already silently in production.

## Run: 2026-04-15 (Run 4)

### Summary
- Scanned: tell/page.tsx, api/tell/draft/update, ask/page.tsx, signup/page.tsx, app-url.ts, middleware.ts, admin/drafts, api/ask, ai/prompts.ts, ai/tell-prompts.ts, home page, git history (3 post-nightshift commits)
- Issues found: 3 new (FIX-013 already had plan, FIX-014, FIX-015 new) — all `planned`
- Issues resolved: FIX-008–012 confirmed resolved (commit 2c00b5d, verified in code)
- Ideas: 2 parked (IDEA-003, IDEA-004 — 3-day stale), 2 new (IDEA-012 seed, IDEA-013 seed → planned)
- Plans written:
  - `FIXPLAN-FIX-014-tell-double-submit.md`
  - `FIXPLAN-FIX-015-submit-draft-no-guard.md`
  - `DEVPLAN-IDEA-013-story-reading-progress.md`

### Build & Lint Results
- `npm run build`: **PASSES** — clean, no warnings. 26 routes (added `/api/tell/draft/update`). Turbopack build in 4.3s.
- `npm run lint`: **PASSES** — 0 warnings, 0 errors. FIX-012 confirmed resolved.

### Key Findings

1. **FIX-008–012 all resolved in one session** (commit `2c00b5d`) — Paul shipped all 5 planned fixes same day they were written. Tell draft persistence, rate limiting, wiki cache, dead params, and lint warning all resolved. The nightshift-to-execution cycle is working.

2. **Major content update (commit `4b209d3`)** — All 39 story wiki files were substantially rewritten/improved. 14 new timeline photos added to `public/timeline/`. Ask page received significant improvements (sendInFlightRef double-submit guard, useCallback, SSE text batching for React Strict Mode safety, journey-aware context, markdown hyperlinks to story pages).

3. **FIX-013 (MEDIUM): Auth redirect changes uncommitted** — Four files in the working tree fix Vercel auth redirect URLs via a new `getAuthRedirectOrigin()` utility (`src/lib/app-url.ts`). A plan file was written manually but not committed. A fresh clone or Vercel deployment would silently lose this fix. The `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` env var isn't yet in the example file either. A 5-minute commit resolves this.

4. **FIX-014 (LOW): Tell page missing sendInFlightRef** — Paul's ask/page.tsx commit added `sendInFlightRef` to prevent double-submit race conditions. The fix was not ported to `tell/page.tsx`, which still uses the weaker `loading` state guard. 5-minute port.

5. **FIX-015 (LOW): submitDraft() has no submitting guard** — "Submit Story" button has no `disabled` prop or in-progress state. Double-click fires two PATCH requests. No data loss risk, but adds `submitting` state for UX quality. 10-minute fix.

6. **IDEA-003 + IDEA-004 parked** — Age-aware chips (IDEA-003) and bookmarks (IDEA-004) both 3+ days with no related commits. Parked per stale rule. IDEA-003's plan remains valid for a 20-minute pickup if prioritized.

7. **IDEA-013 (Reading Progress) advanced to `planned` same night** — Clear technical path: Supabase migration 004 (`sb_story_reads`), `ReadTracker` client component on story pages, read badges in library, progress bar on profile. Estimated 1.5 hours. No dependencies.

### Plans Ready to Execute
- `docs/nightshift/plans/FIXPLAN-FIX-013-uncommitted-signup-changes.md` — Commit the auth redirect changes (5 min, prevents silent loss)
- `docs/nightshift/plans/DEVPLAN-IDEA-007-resume-tell-session.md` — Resume in-progress Tell sessions (1.5-2 hrs)
- `docs/nightshift/plans/DEVPLAN-IDEA-013-story-reading-progress.md` — Story reading progress tracking (1.5 hrs, needs migration 004)
- `docs/nightshift/plans/FIXPLAN-FIX-014-tell-double-submit.md` — Port sendInFlightRef to Tell (5 min)
- `docs/nightshift/plans/FIXPLAN-FIX-015-submit-draft-no-guard.md` — submitDraft in-progress guard (10 min)

### Recommendations
- **If you have 15 min:** FIX-013 (commit auth changes, 5 min) + FIX-014 + FIX-015 back-to-back. Three clean fixes that close all open issues.
- **If you have 2 hours:** The 15-min batch above, then IDEA-007 (Resume Tell session, 1.5 hrs). After this: Tell pipeline is fully polished and zero open bugs remain.
- **If you have a full session:** Everything above + IDEA-013 (Reading Progress, 1.5 hrs). The app gains tracking infrastructure and the family sees their journey through the archive.

## Run: 2026-04-14 (Run 3)

### Summary
- Scanned: new `/tell` feature (tell/page.tsx, /api/tell, /api/tell/draft), /admin/drafts, supabase-stories.ts, migration 003, journeys routes, ask/page.tsx updates, build + lint
- Issues found: 5 new (FIX-008 through FIX-012) — all `found` → `planned` same night
- Issues resolved: 0 this run (7 total already resolved from prior runs)
- Ideas: IDEA-001 marked `shipped`, IDEA-002 advanced to `planned`, 2 new seeds (IDEA-007, IDEA-008), IDEA-007 immediately advanced to `ready`
- Plans written:
  - `FIXPLAN-FIX-008-submit-draft-ignores-edits.md`
  - `FIXPLAN-FIX-009-tell-draft-rate-limiting.md`
  - `FIXPLAN-FIX-010-tell-prompts-wiki-cache.md`
  - `FIXPLAN-FIX-011-dead-generatestaticparams-journeys.md`
  - `FIXPLAN-FIX-012-unused-node-lint-warning.md`
  - `DEVPLAN-IDEA-007-resume-tell-session.md`

### Build & Lint Results
- `npm run build`: **PASSES** — clean, no warnings. All 25 routes render as ƒ (Dynamic). New routes: `/tell`, `/admin/drafts`, `/api/tell`, `/api/tell/draft`.
- `npm run lint`: **1 warning** (not an error) — `_node` unused in `ask/page.tsx:10`. No errors.

### Key Findings

1. **IDEA-001 (Guided Journeys) SHIPPED** — Paul implemented the full journeys feature as part of the `3d56213` + `85356d4` commits. Four journeys live at `/journeys`. Routes include intro, step-by-step reader with reflection prompts, journey connectors, and completion page. Progress tracked via localStorage. This was the P1 backlog item.

2. **IDEA-002 (Story Workshop) Track 1 SHIPPED as `/tell`** — The `cad049d` commit implements a full story contribution pipeline: AI interviewer chat → draft composition → admin review → publish. Family members can tell stories at `/tell`; Paul reviews and publishes at `/admin/drafts`. Story IDs generalized to `P{n}_S{nn}` for multi-volume support.

3. **FIX-008 (HIGH): submitDraft ignores user edits** — `tell/page.tsx` `submitDraft()` just sets `submitted: true` without persisting `editTitle`/`editBody` back to Supabase. Users can edit the AI-composed draft but those edits are silently lost. A PATCH endpoint + 5-line change in `submitDraft()` fixes this.

4. **FIX-009 (MEDIUM): /api/tell/draft has no rate limit** — This is the most expensive Claude call in the app (4096 tokens). Unlike `/api/tell` (20/min) and `/api/ask` (20/min), the draft endpoint is unguarded. Also: on parse error, returns `{ raw: rawText }` leaking Claude's response.

5. **FIX-010: getWikiSummaries() reads disk on every /api/tell call** — `parser.ts` exports an uncached `getWikiSummaries()`. `tell-prompts.ts` calls it on every chat turn. The Ask system already caches this. One-line fix in `tell-prompts.ts`.

6. **FIX-011: Dead generateStaticParams reintroduced in journeys** — Same issue as FIX-006 (resolved for stories/themes) but the journey routes export it again. Both `journeys/[slug]/page.tsx` and `journeys/[slug]/[step]/page.tsx` affected. Dead code, 5-min cleanup.

7. **Ask page significantly improved** — `ask/page.tsx` now has: `sendInFlightRef` for double-submit prevention, `useCallback` memoization, `journeySlug` awareness in prompt, batch SSE text accumulation (immutable updater for React Strict Mode), and markdown hyperlinks to story pages.

### Plans Ready to Execute
- `docs/nightshift/plans/FIXPLAN-FIX-008-submit-draft-ignores-edits.md` — Save user edits on Tell draft submission (30 min, HIGH priority)
- `docs/nightshift/plans/FIXPLAN-FIX-009-tell-draft-rate-limiting.md` — Rate limit /api/tell/draft, remove raw leak (15 min)
- `docs/nightshift/plans/DEVPLAN-IDEA-003-age-aware-suggestion-chips.md` — Age-aware chips in Ask (20 min, no deps)
- `docs/nightshift/plans/DEVPLAN-IDEA-007-resume-tell-session.md` — Resume in-progress Tell sessions (1.5-2 hrs)
- `docs/nightshift/plans/FIXPLAN-FIX-010-tell-prompts-wiki-cache.md` — Cache wiki summaries in tell-prompts (10 min)
- `docs/nightshift/plans/FIXPLAN-FIX-011-dead-generatestaticparams-journeys.md` — Remove dead params from journeys (5 min)

### Recommendations
- **If you have 30 min:** FIX-008 + FIX-009 back-to-back. FIX-008 prevents data loss (user edits disappear), FIX-009 is a financial safety fix. Both are small, targeted changes.
- **If you have 2 hours:** The 30-min batch above, then IDEA-003 (age chips, 20 min) and IDEA-007 (resume Tell session, 1.5 hrs). After this batch: the Tell pipeline is production-quality and the Ask experience is fully age-aware.

## Run: 2026-04-13 (Run 2)

### Summary
- Scanned: all routes, hooks, API handlers, AI prompts, build output, lint results
- Issues found: 2 new (`found` → `planned` same night), 5 existing (all still open, no code commits since Run 1), 0 resolved
- Ideas: 2 new seeds (IDEA-005, IDEA-006), 1 promoted (IDEA-003: seed → ready), all others holding
- Plans written:
  - `FIXPLAN-FIX-006-dead-generatestaticparams.md`
  - `FIXPLAN-FIX-007-sse-chunk-fragility.md`
  - `DEVPLAN-IDEA-003-age-aware-suggestion-chips.md`

### Build & Lint Results
- `npm run build`: **PASSES** — 1 deprecation warning (FIX-001 still open: middleware → proxy). All routes Dynamic (ƒ). Build took ~17 min.
- `npm run lint`: **FAILS** — same 2 errors, 3 warnings in `scripts/compile-wiki.ts` (FIX-002 still open). No new lint errors.

### Key Findings
1. **No code changes since Run 1** — All 5 fixes from last night are still open. Paul hasn't had a session yet. Plans are queued and ready.
2. **SSE stream parsing fragility** (FIX-007, new) — `ask/page.tsx` splits stream chunks on `\n` without buffering. TCP packet boundaries can split SSE lines, causing `JSON.parse()` to throw and killing the stream mid-response. Fix: accumulate a buffer across chunks, parse only complete lines, per-line try/catch. Plan written.
3. **Dead `generateStaticParams`** (FIX-006, new) — Story/theme detail pages define `generateStaticParams` but render dynamically due to the auth layout reading cookies. The exports are dead code. Low severity — app works correctly — but they add noise and a few extra seconds to the build. Plan written (5-min fix).
4. **Suggestion chips confirmed hardcoded** — Verified in `ask/page.tsx` lines 143-148. The `useAgeMode()` hook IS imported, `ageMode` IS available. The fix is exactly as IDEA-003 described. Advanced to `ready`, dev plan written (20-min change).
5. **AI prompt is solid** — `buildSystemPrompt` in `src/lib/ai/prompts.ts` is well-constructed. Voice guide, wiki index, story context, and age mode instructions are all assembled cleanly. File caching (`cachedWikiSummaries`, `cachedVoiceGuide`) prevents repeated disk reads. No issues.

### Plans Ready to Execute
- `docs/nightshift/plans/FIXPLAN-FIX-001-middleware-to-proxy.md` — Rename middleware.ts → proxy.ts (5 min)
- `docs/nightshift/plans/FIXPLAN-FIX-003-story-fulltext-markdown.md` — Use ReactMarkdown for story text (10 min)
- `docs/nightshift/plans/DEVPLAN-IDEA-003-age-aware-suggestion-chips.md` — Age-aware suggestion chips in Ask (20 min, no deps)
- `docs/nightshift/plans/FIXPLAN-FIX-007-sse-chunk-fragility.md` — Robust SSE stream parsing (30 min)
- `docs/nightshift/plans/FIXPLAN-FIX-004-ask-api-rate-limiting.md` — Per-user rate limiting on /api/ask (30 min)
- `docs/nightshift/plans/DEVPLAN-IDEA-001-guided-journeys.md` — Full Guided Journeys feature (4–6 hours, do FIX-003 first)

### Recommendations
- **If you have 30 min:** FIX-001 + FIX-003 + IDEA-003 — eliminate the build warning, fix markdown rendering, and make suggestion chips age-aware. Three separate plan files, all self-contained, can be done back-to-back.
- **If you have 2 hours:** The 30-min batch above, then FIX-007 (SSE buffering) and FIX-004 (rate limiting). Clears the medium-severity backlog entirely.

## Run: 2026-04-12 (Run 1 — First Full Scan)

### Summary
- Scanned: all 31 source files (routes, components, hooks, lib, scripts, migration, wiki content)
- Issues found: 5 new (`found` → `planned` same night), 0 existing, 0 resolved
- Ideas: 2 new seeds (IDEA-003, IDEA-004), 1 promoted (IDEA-001: seed → ready), 1 advanced (IDEA-002: seed → exploring)
- Plans written:
  - `FIXPLAN-FIX-001-middleware-to-proxy.md`
  - `FIXPLAN-FIX-002-compile-wiki-lint-errors.md`
  - `FIXPLAN-FIX-003-story-fulltext-markdown.md`
  - `FIXPLAN-FIX-004-ask-api-rate-limiting.md`
  - `FIXPLAN-FIX-005-orphaned-user-messages.md`
  - `DEVPLAN-IDEA-001-guided-journeys.md`

### Build & Lint Results
- `npm run build`: **PASSES** — 1 deprecation warning (FIX-001: middleware → proxy)
- `npm run lint`: **FAILS** — 2 errors, 3 warnings in `scripts/compile-wiki.ts` (FIX-002)
- All routes render as Dynamic (ƒ) — correct for auth-dependent app

### Key Findings
1. **Next.js 16 middleware deprecation** — `src/middleware.ts` needs to become `src/proxy.ts`. The build warns on every run. Easy 5-minute fix.
2. **Story full text missing markdown rendering** — `stories/[storyId]/page.tsx` splits text on newlines manually instead of using `ReactMarkdown`. The package is already installed and used in Ask. Quick fix with visible UX benefit.
3. **No rate limiting on /api/ask** — Any authenticated user can fire unlimited Claude API calls. In-memory sliding window limiter would cost <30min and prevent surprise bills.
4. **RLS is solid** — All three tables have proper policies. No auth gaps found. `sb_profiles.role` field exists for admin use but admin-gated routes don't exist yet.
5. **Age mode affects AI prompt only** — The system prompt adapts well by mode. But suggestion chips in Ask are hardcoded for adults, and story UI doesn't vary by mode at all. IDEA-003 addresses this.

### Plans Ready to Execute
- `docs/nightshift/plans/FIXPLAN-FIX-001-middleware-to-proxy.md` — Rename middleware.ts → proxy.ts (5 min)
- `docs/nightshift/plans/FIXPLAN-FIX-003-story-fulltext-markdown.md` — Use ReactMarkdown for story text (10 min)
- `docs/nightshift/plans/FIXPLAN-FIX-004-ask-api-rate-limiting.md` — Add per-user rate limit to /api/ask (30 min)
- `docs/nightshift/plans/DEVPLAN-IDEA-001-guided-journeys.md` — Full Guided Journeys feature (4–6 hours)

### Recommendations
- **If you have 15 min:** Do FIX-001 and FIX-003 back to back — eliminates the build warning and improves story rendering with minimal effort.
- **If you have 2 hours:** FIX-004 (rate limiting) + start Phase 1 of IDEA-001 (create journey content files and parser). Phase 1 is just markdown files and a TypeScript parser — no UI yet.
