  - 2026-04-17: **Profile reading dashboard SHIPPED** — `ProfileReadingDashboard.tsx` shows read count, most-recent date, top themes, top principles on `/profile`. Story card read badges still pending (see IDEA-014). Marking this shipped; IDEA-014 handles the remaining badge work.

---

### [IDEA-014] Story Read Progress UI — Story Card Read Badges
- **Status:** ready
- **Category:** enhance
- **Seeded:** 2026-04-16
- **Last Updated:** 2026-04-17
- **Priority:** P2
- **Plan:** `docs/nightshift/plans/DEVPLAN-IDEA-014-story-read-progress-ui.md`
- **Summary:** The profile reading dashboard (count, themes, principles) shipped in Run 6. The remaining piece: small "Read" badges on story cards in the story library, so family members can spot which stories they've already visited without clicking each one.
- **Night Notes:**
  - 2026-04-16: Seeded and advanced to `ready` same night. DB + API + ReadTracker all confirmed working. Only UI elements remain. Plan written.
  - 2026-04-17: **Profile progress dashboard portion SHIPPED** (ProfileReadingDashboard on `/profile`). Story card badges (Phase 2 of the plan) remain. Plan still valid — only Phase 2 needs execution now. Estimated ~45 min remaining work.
  - 2026-04-18: `ProfileReadingDashboard` has been superseded by the new reflection gallery (IDEA-020). Story card "Read" badges (Phase 2) are still open and remain the only outstanding piece.

---

### [IDEA-020] Profile as Reflection Gallery
- **Status:** shipped
- **Category:** enhance
- **Seeded:** 2026-04-18
- **Last Updated:** 2026-04-18
- **Priority:** P1
- **Spec:** `docs/nightshift/specs/2026-04-18-profile-reflection-gallery-design.md`
- **Plan:** `docs/nightshift/plans/DEVPLAN-IDEA-020-profile-reflection-gallery.md`
- **Summary:** Reworked `/profile` (non-Keith users) into a reflective mirror: AI narrator reflection as hero, gallery of signal tiles (featured passage, with-Keith-since, principles, dialogue with Keith, themes, keepers, ghosted future "Keith's people" tile). Utility actions demoted to subtle top-right icons (tour, admin, sign-out). Keith special-access profile untouched.
- **Night Notes:**
  - 2026-04-18: Spec + plan written and implemented end-to-end on `feat/profile-reflection-gallery`. New table `sb_profile_reflections` (migration 019) with cooldown (24h) + trigger (+3 reads, +1 saved, +1 asked) logic. Reuses Claude Sonnet 4 via the existing Anthropic wiring. Deprecated `ProfileHero`, `ProfileReadingDashboard`, and `profile-dashboard.ts` deleted. Pre-existing IDEA-014 Phase 2 (story card read badges) still pending.

- **Status:** shipped
- **Category:** new
- **Seeded:** 2026-04-12
- **Last Updated:** 2026-04-17
- **Priority:** P1
- **Plan:** `docs/nightshift/plans/DEVPLAN-IDEA-004-story-favorites.md`
- **Summary:** Heart icon on every story detail page. Favorited stories collected at `/profile/favorites`, linked from ProfileHero. `sb_story_favorites` table (migration 011), optimistic toggle, clean empty state. Pairs with IDEA-016 (passage highlights) — both surface on the profile page.
- **Night Notes:**
  - 2026-04-12: Seeded by Nightshift.
  - 2026-04-15: Parked — superseded by IDEA-013.

---

### [IDEA-008] "New Stories" Feed on Home Page
- **Status:** parked
- **Category:** new
- **Seeded:** 2026-04-14
- **Last Updated:** 2026-04-17
- **Priority:** P2
- **Plan:** *(not yet written)*
- **Summary:** Home page section showing most recent family-contributed stories (from `getPublishedStories()`). Pairs naturally with IDEA-006.
- **Night Notes:**
  - 2026-04-14: Seeded. `getPublishedStories()` already exists. Pure UI addition, no DB changes.
  - 2026-04-17: Stale 3 days — likely low priority while Paul is shipping bigger features. Demoting to parked. Easy to revisit (no DB changes, pure UI).

---

### [IDEA-010] Public Media Integration — Podcasts, Videos, and Public Sources
- **Status:** parked
- **Category:** new
- **Seeded:** 2026-04-14
- **Last Updated:** 2026-04-17
- **Priority:** P2
- **Plan:** *(not yet written)*
- **Summary:** Curated "Keith in the World" section — podcasts, YouTube interviews, press coverage. Wiki-curated via `content/wiki/media/` files. No backend.
- **Night Notes:**
  - 2026-04-14: Seeded by Paul.
  - 2026-04-17: Stale 3 days — content curation is the blocker (need actual media links), not the code. Demoting to parked. Revisit when Paul has a media list to work from.

---

### [IDEA-011] Story Photos — Images That Surface During Reading
- **Status:** shipped
- **Category:** enhance
- **Seeded:** 2026-04-14
- **Last Updated:** 2026-04-17
- **Priority:** P1
- **Plan:** *(no dev plan written — Paul implemented directly)*
- **Summary:** Associate photos with specific stories via inline markdown syntax. Images render inline as the reader scrolls, with a click-to-expand lightbox. Especially powerful in young_reader mode.
- **Night Notes:**
  - 2026-04-14: Seeded by Paul. Timeline already has 14 photos in `public/timeline/`.
  - 2026-04-17: **SHIPPED.** Commit `c7ebef7` added 35 original book images to `public/book-images/`, updated 17 story wiki files with inline `![...]` image references, and created `StoryMarkdown.tsx` (ReactMarkdown-based renderer with click-to-expand lightbox, "Fit to Screen" / "Actual Size" / "Open Original" controls, keyboard Escape support).

### [IDEA-012] Letter to Keith — Personal Takeaway from an Ask Conversation
- **Status:** parked
- **Category:** new
- **Seeded:** 2026-04-15
- **Last Updated:** 2026-04-18
- **Priority:** P2
- **Plan:** *(not yet written)*
- **Summary:** After an Ask conversation, generate a short personal letter (from the user's perspective) summarizing what they learned. Downloadable. Especially meaningful for grandchildren.
- **Night Notes:**
  - 2026-04-15: Seeded. Non-streaming `/api/ask/letter` endpoint reusing conversation messages state.
  - 2026-04-18: **Stale 3 days — likely low priority while Paul ships Beyond/People/Audio features. Demoting to parked.** Plan would be: POST `/api/ask/letter` with conversation history → single Sonnet call → return formatted letter text → client download as `.txt`. No new DB. Easy to revisit (~45 min).

### [IDEA-016] Save a Passage — Highlight Text from Stories
- **Status:** shipped
- **Category:** new
- **Seeded:** 2026-04-16
- **Last Updated:** 2026-04-17
- **Priority:** P1
- **Plan:** `docs/nightshift/plans/DEVPLAN-IDEA-016-passage-highlights.md`
- **Summary:** Select any text in a story body → floating "Save this passage" button appears → one click saves it to Supabase. All saved passages collected at `/profile/highlights`, grouped by story in a reading-journal layout with blockquote styling. Individual passages can be removed. `sb_story_highlights` table (migration 012). Pairs with IDEA-004 (favorites) — both accessible from the profile page.
- **Night Notes:**
  - 2026-04-16: Seeded and advanced to `ready` same session (Paul explicitly requested). Full dev plan written.
  - 2026-04-17: **SHIPPED.** `StoryBodyWithHighlighting.tsx`, migration 012, all API routes, `/profile/highlights/page.tsx`, `DeleteHighlightButton.tsx`, ProfileHero "✎ My passages" link all confirmed in commit `5dd3116`.

### [IDEA-017] Photo Frame Mode — Fullscreen Rotating Memoir Photos
- **Status:** shipped
- **Category:** new
- **Seeded:** 2026-04-17
- **Last Updated:** 2026-04-18
- **Priority:** P2
- **Plan:** `docs/nightshift/plans/DEVPLAN-IDEA-017-photo-frame.md`
- **Summary:** A "Photo Frame" button on the home page triggers fullscreen mode where all chrome disappears and the 35 memoir photos cycle with a slow crossfade every 8 seconds. Subtle caption (story title + era) at the bottom. Close button reveals on hover; Escape exits. Designed for a tablet left on the table at a family gathering.
- **Night Notes:**
  - 2026-04-17: Seeded as a gallery page; revised to photo frame mode same session (Paul's direction — more evocative, kiosk-style). 35 photos already in `public/book-images/`. Key component: `PhotoFrameOverlay.tsx` — fixed-position, Fullscreen API, crossfade via opacity transition, preloads next image. No new routes, no DB. Estimated 1.5–2 hours.
  - 2026-04-18: **SHIPPED.** `PhotoFrameOverlay.tsx` confirmed in commit `be2d3fd`. Fullscreen API, 8-second advance, 1.2s crossfade, 30s pause-on-tap, preloads next image. Escape and fullscreen exit both close.

### [IDEA-018] Ask Keith About a Saved Passage
- **Status:** ready
- **Category:** new
- **Seeded:** 2026-04-17
- **Last Updated:** 2026-04-17
- **Priority:** P1
- **Plan:** `docs/nightshift/plans/DEVPLAN-IDEA-018-ask-from-passage.md`
- **Summary:** "Ask Keith about this →" button on each saved passage in `/profile/highlights`. Clicking it opens the Ask Keith chat with the saved passage pre-loaded as context, so the AI responds specifically to that quote. Transforms saved passages from a static archive into live conversation starters.
- **Night Notes:**
  - 2026-04-17: Seeded and advanced to `ready` same night. Both IDEA-016 (highlights) and Ask are shipped. This is a pure integration — URL query param on `/ask` + `useEffect` on mount + button in highlights page. Estimated 1 hour. Strong storytelling value for grandchildren.

### [IDEA-019] People Biographical Context in Ask Keith
- **Status:** planned
- **Category:** enhance
- **Seeded:** 2026-04-18
- **Last Updated:** 2026-04-18
- **Priority:** P1
- **Plan:** `docs/nightshift/plans/DEVPLAN-IDEA-019-people-in-ask-keith.md`
- **Summary:** Ask Keith currently only has story summaries when answering questions about people. The wiki already has 58 people pages with rich AI-drafted bios (confirmed for Tier A figures like Bayne Cobb, Frances Cobb, etc.). Adding a `getPeopleContext()` loader to `src/lib/ai/prompts.ts` that reads the `ai-draft` section from each person's wiki page would make Ask dramatically more knowledgeable when a grandchild asks "Who was Grandpa's dad?" No new DB changes, no new routes — purely a system prompt enhancement. Estimated 1 hour.
- **Night Notes:**
  - 2026-04-18: Seeded and advanced to `planned` same night. Verified: `content/wiki/people/bayne-cobb.md` has a full 300-word bio with quotes and notable moments. The `getWikiSummaries()` call only loads `index.md` (one-line per person). People wiki pages are NOT included in the system prompt today. Gap confirmed. Dev plan written.

### [IDEA-021] Reading Milestone Celebration — Complete All 39 Memoir Stories
- **Status:** seed
- **Category:** new
- **Seeded:** 2026-04-18
- **Last Updated:** 2026-04-18
- **Priority:** P2
- **Plan:** *(not yet written)*
- **Summary:** When a family member reads their 39th memoir story (`sb_story_reads` count reaches 39 for P1_S* stories), show a special congratulations moment — "You've walked the full journey with Grandpa" — as a fullscreen overlay or celebratory toast with a meaningful message. The `sb_story_reads` infrastructure is fully in place; this is purely a celebration UI layer on top of the ReadTracker component. Especially meaningful for grandchildren who read the whole book.
- **Night Notes:**
  - 2026-04-18: Seeded. Implementation sketch: `ReadTracker` component checks total memoir story read count after each successful POST; if it hits 39 for the first time, fires a callback to parent page. Parent page shows `MilestoneOverlay.tsx` (similar pattern to `PhotoFrameOverlay.tsx`). No new DB columns needed — just a count query on `sb_story_reads` where story_id like `P1_%`.

### [IDEA-015] Enable Deep Ask — Multi-Perspective Responses in Production
- **Status:** ready
- **Category:** new
- **Seeded:** 2026-04-16
- **Last Updated:** 2026-04-16
- **Priority:** P2
- **Plan:** `docs/nightshift/plans/DEVPLAN-IDEA-015-deep-ask-activation.md`
- **Summary:** The multi-perspective Ask orchestrator (storyteller + principles coach → synthesizer) is fully implemented and feature-flagged via `ENABLE_DEEP_ASK=true`. The classifier now defaults to "deep" for all reflective questions. Activating it requires reviewing the perspective prompts in `perspectives.ts`, testing locally, then setting the env var in Vercel. Estimated 30 min eval + 5 min deploy.
- **Night Notes:**
  - 2026-04-16: Seeded and advanced to `ready` same night. `orchestrator.ts`, `classifier.ts`, `perspectives.ts` all confirmed in codebase. Plan written.
