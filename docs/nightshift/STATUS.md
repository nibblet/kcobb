# STATUS — Keith Cobb Interactive Storybook

> Last updated: 2026-04-20 (Nightshift Run 9)

## App Summary

**Keith Cobb Interactive Storybook** is a private, family-only digital archive built around 49 stories (39 memoir + 10 interview) from Keith Cobb's life and leadership journey. Family members (especially grandchildren and great-grandchildren) can browse stories, explore principles/themes, view a life timeline, have AI-guided conversations ("Ask Keith"), follow curated Guided Journeys, contribute their own stories via the "Tell" feature, write notes/questions directly to Keith from any story page, flag OCR errors, bookmark favorites, save passages, browse the People directory, and experience a photo frame slideshow of original memoir photos.

**Domain:** stories.cobbcorner.com

## Architecture

### Wiki-First Content
- All Keith's stories (Volume 1 = memoir P1_S01–P1_S39, IV = interview IV_S01–IV_S10) live in `content/wiki/` as markdown files
- People inventory compiled from `content/raw/people_inventory.json` into `content/wiki/people/` (58 people pages)
- Compiled from `content/raw/` via `scripts/compile-wiki.ts`
- Static data generated via `scripts/generate-static-data.ts` into `src/lib/wiki/static-data.ts`
- Family-contributed stories (Volume 2+) live in Supabase (`sb_story_drafts` with `status='published'`)
- Story detail page falls back from filesystem to Supabase for non-P1/IV story IDs

### Database (Supabase)
- **20 migrations** (up from 17 last run):
  - `001_initial_schema.sql` — base tables
  - `002_signup_profile_age.sql` — age + age_mode on profiles
  - `003_story_sessions.sql` — Tell sessions
  - `004_story_contribution_mode.sql` — beyond vs. tell contribution_mode
  - `005_keith_role.sql` + `005_story_reads.sql` — keith role + read tracking (dual 005 — apply both)
  - `006_chapter_questions.sql` — reader Q&A tables
  - `007_public_qna_read.sql` — RLS for public Q&A reads
  - `008_story_sessions_from_question.sql` — seed sessions from questions
  - `009_qna_rls_no_recursion.sql` — breaks RLS recursion in Q&A
  - `010_asker_seen.sql` — unread tracking for reader answers
  - `011_story_favorites.sql` — `sb_story_favorites` table (heart icon bookmarks)
  - `012_story_highlights.sql` — `sb_story_highlights` table (saved text passages)
  - `013_onboarding_flags.sql` — `has_onboarded` + `onboarded_at` on `sb_profiles`; existing users pre-seeded to true
  - `013_story_corrections.sql` — **DUPLICATE PREFIX** (see FIX-022); `sb_story_corrections` table for reader OCR error reports
  - `014_story_audio.sql` — `sb_story_audio` ledger + `story-audio` Storage bucket for ElevenLabs cache

### Auth / Middleware
- Auth enforced via `src/proxy.ts` (Next.js 16 format)
- All routes except `/login`, `/signup`, `/auth/callback`, `/welcome`, `/api/*` require authentication
- Admin routes (`/admin/*`, `/api/admin/*`) gated by `sb_profiles.role = 'admin'`
- Keith routes (`/beyond`, `/api/beyond/*`) gated by `hasKeithSpecialAccess()` — checks `role = 'keith'` OR email match in `src/lib/auth/special-access.ts`
- **Onboarding gate:** `proxy.ts` redirects new (non-onboarded) users to `/welcome`
  - Fast-path: `sb_onboarded` cookie (1-year TTL) bypasses DB check on steady-state requests
  - On cache miss: queries `sb_profiles.has_onboarded`; sets cookie on first confirmed onboarded status

### Age Mode System
- Three modes: `young_reader` (3-10), `teen` (11-17), `adult` (18+)
- Derived from `sb_profiles.age` or set manually on profile page
- Context provider: `src/hooks/useAgeMode.tsx`
- Affects: AI system prompt language/depth, story audio controls

### AI / Ask Keith
- System prompt built in `src/lib/ai/prompts.ts`
- **Multi-perspective orchestrator** in `src/lib/ai/orchestrator.ts`:
  - Simple path: single Sonnet call (factual/list/lookup questions)
  - Deep path: storyteller + principles coach (parallel) → synthesizer (streamed)
  - Feature-flagged via `ENABLE_DEEP_ASK=true` env var (currently disabled in prod)
  - Depth classifier: `src/lib/ai/classifier.ts` — defaults to "deep", simple only for factual patterns
  - Perspective prompts: `src/lib/ai/perspectives.ts`
- Rate limiting: 20 req/min per user
- Double-submit guard: `sendInFlightRef` in `ask/page.tsx`
- SSE stream parsing: buffered with TextDecoder stream:true, per-line try/catch
- **People context:** `getPeopleContext()` in `prompts.ts` includes Tier A/B bios (IDEA-019, shipped)
- **Corpus integration (Run 8):** orchestrator calls `getCanonicalWikiSummaries()` + `getCanonicalStoryLinkCatalog()` from `corpus.ts` — Beyond family stories now visible to Ask Keith after publish
- **Principles gap:** 12 canonical principles with rich `aiNarrative` exist in parser but are NOT yet in the Ask system prompt — see IDEA-022
- `?prompt=` URL parameter added to Ask page — used by principle "Ask About This" CTAs

### AI / Tell + Beyond (Story Contribution)
- System prompt in `src/lib/ai/tell-prompts.ts` with two modes: `gathering` and `drafting`
- `StoryContributionWorkspace` component handles `/tell` (family)
- Beyond workspace has 3 mode tabs: QA, Edit, People
- **Beyond Edit Mode** — `BeyondEditMode.tsx` + `BeyondDraftEditor.tsx` + `TipTapEditor.tsx`:
  - `sb_story_drafts.session_id` is now nullable (`origin = 'write'` for direct writes)
  - Keith can open a published story chapter as a draft for revision (`origin = 'edit'`)
  - TipTap WYSIWYG editor with @mention support (people autocomplete via `api/people`)
  - AI Polish panel for targeted paragraph improvements
  - Warning gate when opening published chapters to prevent accidental overwrites
- `contributionMode: "tell" | "beyond"` controls which API endpoints are called
- Beyond workspace: shows pending reader questions in triage strip; Keith can quick-answer or seed a session from a question
- Rate limiting: 20/min gathering, 5/min drafting
- Resume sessions: in-progress sessions show on empty state with "Continue" button

### Reader Q&A System
- **Reader flow:** Click "Write to Keith" on any story page → `AskAboutStory` form → POST `/api/stories/[storyId]/questions` → question shows in Keith's Beyond triage strip
- **Keith flow:** See pending questions in Beyond QA tab → quick-answer (text only) OR seed a Beyond session (AI-assisted story expansion) → answer appears on story page
- **Visibility:** `public` (shown to all readers) or `private` (only to the asker)
- **Notifications:** Profile nav shows dot (readers with new answers) or count badge (Keith with pending questions)

### Story Audio
- **ElevenLabs TTS** (primary): server-side synthesis, MP3 cached in `story-audio` Supabase Storage bucket
  - `sb_story_audio` ledger tracks (story_id, voice_id) unique pairs
  - `/api/stories/[storyId]/audio` returns cached URL or triggers generation
  - `/api/stories/[storyId]/audio/stream` — streaming TTS for low-latency first play
  - Rate limited: 5/15min per user (to bound ElevenLabs spend)
  - Falls back to Web Speech API if ElevenLabs not configured or errors
- **Web Speech API** (fallback): browser-native TTS, no server cost
- `StoryAudioControls.tsx` — unified component, defaults to `mode="elevenlabs"`, falls back automatically
- ElevenLabs config: `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` + `ELEVENLABS_VOICE_ID` env vars (see `.env.local.example`)

### Story Corrections
- Any authenticated reader can flag an OCR/transcription error from a story page
- `sb_story_corrections` table with status `open` | `resolved`
- Admin triage at `/profile/admin` — `CorrectionActions.tsx` to resolve/dismiss
- Rate limited: 20/min per user

### People Inventory (NEW in Run 7)
- 58 people pages compiled from `content/raw/people_inventory.json` + overrides
- Wiki pages in `content/wiki/people/` (one per person, with AI-drafted bios for major figures)
- Tiers: A (dedicated story), B (recurring), C (curated), D (across memoir + interviews)
- Routes: `/people` (directory) + `/people/[slug]` (detail with stories, bio, media)
- `PersonEditDrawer` — Keith-only inline editor for bio, relationship, birth/death year
- `PersonMediaPanel` — photo gallery attached to a person (from `sb_media`)
- `sb_people` (DB source of truth for bio, overrides wiki markdown bio)
- `sb_story_people` link table — connects stories to mentioned people via @mentions
- `PersonLink.tsx` — inline person mention chip (links to `/people/[slug]`)

### Media Attachments (NEW in Run 7)
- `sb_media` — polymorphic: owner_type = 'story' | 'person', owner_id = draft UUID or story_id string
- `beyond-media` Supabase Storage bucket (see `supabase/storage-setup.sql`)
- `MediaGallery.tsx` — editable gallery in Beyond (caption edit, sort, delete)
- `/api/beyond/media` — list, upload, update, soft-delete (keith/admin-gated)
- Photos are non-sensitive; bucket is public; app auth gates the UI

### Story Read Tracking + User Reading Dashboard
- `sb_story_reads` table — upsert on story visit, user_id + story_id (unique)
- `ReadTracker` component fires POST silently on story page load
- Keith's analytics dashboard (`keith-dashboard.ts`) shows read metrics
- `ProfileReadingDashboard.tsx` — shown on `/profile` for family members: read count, most-recent date, top 3 themes, top 4 principles
- Story card read badges still pending (IDEA-014)

### Photo Frame (NEW in Run 7 — IDEA-017 SHIPPED)
- `PhotoFrameOverlay.tsx` — fullscreen crossfade slideshow of 35 memoir photos
- Triggered from home page button
- Fullscreen API, 8-second advance, 1.2s crossfade, 30s pause-on-tap, preloads next image
- Escape key or fullscreen exit closes the overlay

### Guided Journeys
- 4 journeys in `content/wiki/journeys/`: growing-up-in-the-south, leadership-under-pressure, roots-and-values, the-making-of-a-career
- Progress tracked via localStorage (no DB required)

### Story Favorites + Highlights
- **`FavoriteButton.tsx`** — heart toggle on story detail pages
- **`/profile/favorites`** — grid of bookmarked stories
- **`StoryBodyWithHighlighting.tsx`** — text selection + floating "Save this passage" button
- **`/profile/highlights`** — reading-journal layout of saved passages grouped by story

### Welcome / Onboarding
- `/welcome` — first-run tour for new family members (4-step age-aware walkthrough)
- New users auto-redirected to `/welcome` by proxy gate (cookie fast-path)

### Book Images — Original Memoir Photos
- 35 JPEG photos in `public/book-images/`
- Referenced inline in 17 story wiki files
- `StoryMarkdown.tsx` renders with click-to-expand lightbox

### Content Pipeline (cobb_brain_lab/)
- 39 memoir stories (P1_S01–P1_S39) + 10 interview stories (IV_S01–IV_S10)
- People inventory: `cobb_brain_lab/` + `content/raw/people_inventory.json`
- `book_images_manifest.csv` — 35 images with page refs and xref IDs

### Timeline
- 43 events across life stages
- 14 photos added to `public/timeline/`

## Conventions
- All Supabase tables prefixed with `sb_`
- Story IDs: `P{volume}_S{nn}` (memoir), `IV_S{nn}` (interview)
- Theme slugs: kebab-case, matching filenames in `content/wiki/themes/`
- Wiki files: single source of truth for Volume 1 content
- Server components by default; client components marked with `'use client'`
- Rate limiter key pattern: `userId` for chat, `${userId}:draft` for drafting, `${userId}:question` for Q&A (10/hr)
- Keith-gated features use `hasKeithSpecialAccess(email, role)` from `src/lib/auth/special-access.ts`
- People API: GET is public (no auth required for `/api/people`); POST/PATCH is Keith-gated

- `src/lib/wiki/corpus.ts` — merged filesystem + DB story corpus; `getCanonicalStories()`, `getCanonicalWikiSummaries()`, `getCanonicalStoryLinkCatalog()`; 30-second in-memory cache
- On Beyond publish: `publishStoryToWikiMirror()` supersedes old doc, inserts new one, then calls `rebuildDerivedWikiMirrorDocuments()` (theme, timeline, index docs)
- Ask Keith now sees Beyond family stories after they publish (corpus feeds system prompt via orchestrator)

### Principles as First-Class Items (NEW in Run 8)
- 12 canonical principles defined in `src/lib/wiki/parser.ts` (line 184) with slug, title, shortTitle, thesis, narrative, aiNarrative, themeSlugs, matchTerms, seedStoryIds
- `getAllCanonicalPrinciples()` matches raw story principles to canonical definitions via scoring

- **Commit `379292a`:** Interview wiki files normalized (all 10 IV stories hand-curated); `CURATED_STORY_IDS.txt` locks all 10 from compiler overwrite; `scripts/compile-interview-stories.ts` added for deterministic regeneration of interview wiki pages from Coffee with Cagnetta transcript; `ReadBadge.tsx` minor tweak

### ⚠️ Known Data Bug (Run 9)
- `storiesData.length = 50` instead of expected 49 — see **FIX-027**
- Root cause: two wiki files exist for P1_S02 (`P1_S02-a-v-ery-busy-teenager.md` and `P1_S02-a-very-busy-teenager.md`)
- Effect: story library shows duplicate P1_S02 card; progress bar can never reach 100% for memoir readers (stuck at 49/50 = 98%)

## Current State
- All features complete: stories (with read badges + progress bar), themes, timeline, ask (corpus-aware + people bios + **principles context**), journeys, tell, beyond (QA + Edit + People modes + wiki publish pipeline), admin, signup/profile (reflection gallery + stories read progress), reader Q&A, favorites, highlights, onboarding tour, book image lightbox, photo frame, people directory, media attachments, ElevenLabs audio, story corrections, **principles browser**, **wiki mirror**
- Build: **PASSES** — clean, 54 routes
- Lint: **PASSES** — 0 errors, 0 warnings
- Tests: **41 PASS** — `npm test` (Node built-in test runner)
- **Note on migration numbering:** Two migrations named `013_*` — see FIX-022 (low-risk naming conflict)
- **⚠️ Data bug:** `storiesData` has duplicate P1_S02 entry (FIX-027, medium priority, easy fix)
- 7 open issues (FIX-013, FIX-014, FIX-016, FIX-017, FIX-022, FIX-026, FIX-027)

## Known Issues (See FIXES.md)
